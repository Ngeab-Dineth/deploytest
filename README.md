# Git flow methods

I followed Git Flow methdology.
The final merged branch for our project is main branch .

## Branches:

I used 3 main branch for my project :

- `main` branch: it represents the latest production-ready state of my project. It contains stable code that is suitable for deployment.

- `develop` branch: it is where ongoing development and integration of new features occur. It's a branch from which feature branches are created and merged back once the features are complete.

- `feature` branch: for each new feature, a dedicated feature branch was created from the develop branch. Feature branches are where the actual coding takes place. To create a feature branch.

# How i worked:

- First of all, a bare bone project is created in Github with main and develop branches.
- i create issues related to the feature that i need to build
- and then i clone repositories and make feature by using `git flow` methodology.
- After finished the feature, i will push publish it and create pull request, and then i reviewed my code again after done review, i merged into develop branch.
